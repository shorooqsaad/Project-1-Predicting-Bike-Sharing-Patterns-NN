# Project-1-Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Patterns-NN
**Predicting Bike Sharing is Neural Network project  in the deep learning Nanodegree**

This project builds Neural Network from Bike sharing Dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset
to predict the number of bikes needed per day
